Goal
----

accept contributions individualy, trust/ban contributors, and commit accepted changes 
to the resp.

If the original author have not put the plugin on the site, the user should fork it
and later submit a pull-request. (should we offer to do it using the site interface?)

A project is url+branch. we should let the author also to refresh the site data from
the resp. (should we do it automatically?)
